# LinearAlgebraCalc

solution.cpp -- is the main file, it contains 3 functions of the entire project:
1) solving SLAE
2) operations on matrices
3) calculating the inverse matrix (4x4 and more takes too long to calculate)


Matrix.h is a file that contains the implementation of the Matrix class and the calculate function.
calculate(Matrix<T> coeffs, vector<T> values) is designed to solve SLAE
